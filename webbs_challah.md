# Challah recipe

Mix in bowl:
* 3 tbs honey
* 2/3 c warm water - 110°F
* 1 + 1/2 tsp active dry yeast

Proof @ 100 ºF for 20 m.

Add:
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1/3 c olive oil
* 1 egg

Beat in kitchenAid with beater blade.

Add:
* 2.5 cups King Arthur unbleached bread flour

Knead with bread hook. Add & knead in as needed to make dough not sticky:
* 1 tablespoon bread flour

Rise @ 100 ºF until it doubles, ~30m, longer at other temperatures.

Knead it down again, then braid.

**Braid**: Separate dough into 4 equal-weight portions. Draw out into ropes and knead. Pattern: outside goes under 2 neighbors and then back over the last one: 1 goes under 2 and 3 to become the new 3, then over 2 to become the new 2. Alternate sides. "Outside goes under 2, back over 1"

Rise @ 100 ºF until it doubles, ~20-30m, longer at other temperatures.
